# About Me

Hi, I’m **@deepakchaudharigit**, a backend developer passionate about building robust and scalable web applications using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **PostgreSQL**. I enjoy crafting efficient APIs, architecting clean backend services, and working with databases to deliver performant, data-driven solutions.

## What I’m Working On

I’m currently focused on:

- Developing production-ready APIs using FastAPI  
- Implementing secure authentication flows with JWT  
- Integrating third-party services like **Masters India GST APIs**  
- Containerizing applications using **Docker**  
- Managing asynchronous tasks and optimizing database interactions  

## What I’m Learning

I’m diving deeper into:

- Advanced FastAPI and dependency injection patterns  
- Git version control workflows and team collaboration  
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment best practices  
- Clean architecture principles for backend systems  

## Open to Collaborate

I’m interested in collaborating on:

- FastAPI or Flask-based API systems  
- Projects that require tight database integrations (PostgreSQL or MySQL)  
- Systems involving financial workflows, APIs, and automation  
- Open source contributions in the Python ecosystem
