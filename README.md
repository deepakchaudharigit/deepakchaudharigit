👋 Hey there, I’m @deepakchaudharigit! 🚀

👀 I’m interested in... crafting awesome web apps with Python, diving into APIs like a code ninja, and making databases dance to my queries! FastAPI and PostgreSQL are my current jam, but I’m always eyeing new tech to conquer. 🐍💾

🌱 I’m currently learning... the art of building slick REST APIs, mastering Git like a version-control wizard, and wrangling Docker containers with style. Oh, and I’m decoding the mysteries of JWT auth—tokens, you’re no match for me! 🔐

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... open-source projects that blend Python, APIs, and a sprinkle of creativity! Got a cool FastAPI or data-driven app idea? Let’s team up and make it shine. ✨

📫 How to reach me... Slide into my GitHub issues, ping me on Twitter (@deepak_codes, if I had one 😜), or conjure a carrier pigeon with a USB drive. I’m all ears for code chats! 🕊️

😄 Pronouns... He/Him, but you can also call me “Code Maestro” or “Bug Slayer” in a pinch. 🛡️

⚡ Fun fact... I once debugged a FastAPI app by talking to my rubber duck, and it quacked the solution! Also, I’m convinced my keyboard has a secret crush on Ctrl+S. 🦆⌨️



🌟 About my coding adventuresI’m knee-deep in building a GST app that’s as smooth as butter, powered by FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and a dash of Docker magic. When I’m not pushing commits or curling endpoints, I’m dreaming up ways to make APIs faster and code cleaner. Check out my repos for some Python-powered goodness!
